# Manual software testing

A little repo with information on how I do manual software
testing. This just covers the more rote side of things -- the part
that's easier to write down. The purpose is to help other people do
some of their own testing.

cf. https://github.com/minimaxir/big-list-of-naughty-strings which is
more complete on the string roundtripping and validation siide of
things.

I may or may not take pull requests or patches on this list -- it's
supposed to represent my own approach. However, if you happen to
mention anything I'm missing, I may include it! It's far from complete
as is.
